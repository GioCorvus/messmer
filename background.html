                    Born of one single god, Messmer was cursed from birth as he bore a vision of fire that he always despised, along with the malevolent snake trying to take over his entire body. As his mother, Marika, couldnâ€™t just rip the entire snake out, since it would be like trying to rip out her son's innards, she sealed it away behind his eyes, replacing it with a Scarseal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Messmer grew up hidden away in the Land of Shadows, raised in the Shaman village, living through countless attempts by his mother to heal him with her blessings, but always keeping company with the original sin, and a hatred that would not be confined.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    As the years unfolded, when Marika was sure that the Base Serpent was kept at bay, and Messmer's health got better, she stopped making blessings for him, as they left the Land of Shadows so Marika could establish her Golden Order. There, Messmer took part in the war against the giants, and the demi-god lived with his mother in Leyndell, even during the time when Radagon had the Carian children.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Then, Messmer's crusade started: He took upon his mother's wish for vengeance for their people. His army was blessed like any other, but the crusade became so violent and bloody at Messmer's hands, that it was reflecting badly on the Golden Order, so the upper echelons shunned and renounced it. Messmer would rather take all the blame on himself than let people know of his mother's past trauma with the hornsent, and what happened to their village and their people, which motivated said crusade.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Because of this and Rykard's bidding, snakes became the symbol of traitors to the Erdtree, but Rellana and the Black Knights were willing to follow him even with all the smear on his reputation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Due to him being far away from the golden grace for too long, the Abyssal Serpent seal started wearing off, so the Black Knights rebelled, thinking it's a righteous stand. Messmer put down the rebellion, but he still gave the Knights proper burial and mourned the loss of his brothers-in-arms.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    When the Elden Ring was shattered, Messmer was stuck in the Land of Shadows, forgotten, not knowing anything of what was happening on the outside, thinking that what was happening was a sign of the Erdtree's wrath. Messmer was alone, weary, longing for his mother's light, protecting what was left of his and Marika's people.
                    </p>
                    <p>Thus, he was left forgotten, alone, carrying his never-ending duty. Always watching, waiting, as the cursed serpent grew within him, always burning with the hatred of his own flame, never able to get rid of it.</p></div>
